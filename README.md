This repository contains a project developed with Angular and RxJS, as part of my daily practices. The project is supported and guided by the courses offered by DevTalles.

## Demonstrated Skills

This project showcases my experience and skills in development with Angular, RxJS, and TypeScript. Here are some of the skills demonstrated:

- Advanced use of Angular:
  - Creation of components, directives, and pipes.
  - Implementation of modules and lazy loading for efficient application loading.
  - Configuration and management of routes for smooth navigation between different views of the application.
  - Usage of services for business logic and communication with external servers.
  - Utilization of HTTP interceptors for manipulation of HTTP requests and responses.
  - Implementation of animations and visual effects with Angular Animations.
  - Creation of reactive forms for efficient data input management.

- Proficiency in RxJS:
  - Utilization of observables and operators to handle asynchronous data streams in a functional and elegant way.
  - Implementation of reactive design patterns such as Observer, Subject, and BehaviorSubject.
  - Error and exception handling in data streams using operators like catchError and retry.

- TypeScript and type handling:
  - Extensive use of static typing to detect errors at compile time.
  - Definition of interfaces and custom types for better organization and readability of code.
  - Implementation of generics to create reusable and flexible components and services.

This project represents a comprehensive set of skills in web development with Angular and RxJS, designed to meet the needs of recruiters interested in candidates with experience in these technologies.
